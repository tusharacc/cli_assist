# JIRA Configuration Example for Lumos CLI
# =========================================
#
# This file shows the expected structure for JIRA integration.
# The actual config will be stored securely at ~/.lumos_jira_config.json
#
# Setup Steps:
# 1. Run: lumos-cli jira config
# 2. Enter your JIRA instance URL
# 3. Enter your email/username
# 4. Enter your Personal Access Token (PAT)
# 5. Optionally set a default project key
#
# Personal Access Token Setup:
# - Go to: https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens
# - Click "Create API token"
# - Give it a name like "Lumos CLI"
# - Copy the generated token
# - Use this token in the configuration
#
# Security Notes:
# - Config file has 600 permissions (owner read/write only)
# - Never commit this file to version control
# - Tokens are stored locally, not transmitted except to your JIRA instance
#
# Common Use Cases:
# ================
#
# Daily workflow:
# lumos-cli jira browse
# → Shows "my tickets in current sprint"
#
# Search specific tickets:
# lumos-cli jira search -q "high priority tickets assigned to me"
#
# Quick comment updates:
# lumos-cli jira comment PROJ-123 -c "Completed implementation, ready for review"
#
# The system intelligently converts natural language to JQL:
# "my open tickets" → "assignee = currentUser() AND status not in (Done, Closed, Resolved)"
# "current sprint" → "sprint in openSprints()"
# "high priority" → "priority in (High, Highest)"
